MoPlot is an R package designed to visualize linear models that include
categorical predictors. It enhances the interpretability of complex
model outputs through clear and intuitive graphical representations,
with a particular focus on the contrasts used for categorical variables.
By highlighting these contrasts, MoPlot helps users better understand
the specific comparisons underlying model estimates.
