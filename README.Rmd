MoPlot is an R package designed to visualize linear models that include categorical predictors. It enhances the interpretability of complex model outputs through clear and intuitive graphical representations, with a particular focus on the contrasts used for categorical variables. By highlighting these contrasts, MoPlot helps users better understand the specific comparisons underlying model estimates.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MoPlot like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Moplot/Moplot")
```

## 1. MoPlotOneWay

`MoPlotOneWay()` is a function for visualizing the results of a linear model with one categorical predictor and one numeric dependent variable. It takes as input a model created with `lm()` and produces a plot that highlights group means with their associated uncertainty using bars, and visually emphasizes significant contrasts through colored lines. Optionally, the raw data points can be displayed in the plot. A secondary panel shows the model coefficients, including standardized beta values and effect sizes such as Cohen’s *d*, allowing for a clear and informative summary of the model's findings.  `MoPlotOneWay()` function supports a variety of contrast coding schemes for categorical predictors, including treatment coding (dummy coding), sum to zero coding, Helmert coding, reverse Helmert coding, polynomial coding, sliding difference coding, and customized coding.

### 1.1 Default Treatment coding

Treatment coding, or dummy coding is a common way to represent categorical variables in regression models. It transforms a categorical predictor with k levels into k − 1 binary (0/1) variables, each comparing one level to a reference (baseline) category.
The following example uses the classic iris dataset with treatment contrasts and shows the plot without raw data points or coefficient panel, using a significance level of 0.05:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
library(MoPlot)

# Using Iris data
data(iris)
iris$Species <- factor(iris$Species)
contrasts(iris$Species) <- contr.treatment(3)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

Here is the same plot, but including raw data points and the coefficient panel, also with a 0.05 significance level:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

### 1.2 Sum coding

Sum coding is another way to represent categorical variables in regression models. Unlike treatment coding, sum coding compares each level to the overall mean rather than a specific reference group. The following example uses again the iris dataset with sum contrasts, showing the plot without raw data points or coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.1

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
# Using Sum coding
contrasts(iris$Species) <- contr.sum(3)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.1)
```

Here is the same plot including raw data points and the coefficient panel:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.1)
```

### 1.3 Helmert coding

Helmert coding is a contrast coding scheme where each level of a categorical variable is compared to the mean of previous levels. The following example uses a generated dataset (using `DatasetOne()`) with Helmert contrasts. It first shows a plot without raw data points or coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.05:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
# Using a custom function to generate data with four groups
DT <- DatasetOne(n_sample = 20, means = c(120, 135, 115, 120), sds = 20)
DT$Ind <- as.factor(DT$Ind)
contrasts(DT$Ind) <- contr.helmert(4)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Dep ~ Ind, data = DT)

# MoPlotting sum
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

Here is the same plot including raw data points and the coefficient panel, using a 0.2 significance level:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting sum
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.2)
```


## 2. MoPlotTwoWay

`MoPlotTwoWay()` is a function for visualizing the results of a linear model with two categorical predictors including their interaction, and one numeric dependent variable. It takes as input a model created with `lm()` and produces a plot that highlights marginal means with their associated uncertainty using error bars. Significant interaction contrasts are visually emphasized using colored lines. Optionally, a secondary panel displays the model coefficients, including standardized beta values and effect sizes such as Cohen’s *d*, providing a clear and informative summary of the model's findings.


### 2.1 Helmert coding x Sum Coding

This example shows how to use `MoPlotTwoWay()` with a linear model where the factors (with interaction) are encoded using **Helmert** and **sum** contrasts. We first show a plot without coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.05:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# Simulating a two way dataset
n <- 200
dt1 <- expand.grid(Ind1 = factor(c("A", "B", "C")), Ind2 = factor(c("X", "Y")))
dt1 <- dt1[rep(1:nrow(dt1), each = n / nrow(dt1)), ]
dt1$y <- with(dt1, 3 + ifelse(Ind1 == "B", 2, ifelse(Ind1 == "C", -1, 0)) +
    ifelse(Ind2 == "Y", 1, 0) + ifelse(Ind1 == "C" & Ind2 == "Y", 2, 0) +
    rnorm(nrow(dt1), 0, 1))

# Applying Helmert and Sum contrasts
contrasts(dt1$Ind1) <- contr.helmert(3)
contrasts(dt1$Ind2) <- contr.sum(2)

# Model fit
modello <- lm(y ~ Ind1 * Ind2, data = dt1)

# Moplotting
MoPlotTwoWay(modello, coef = F, focus = F, sig.level = 0.05)
```

We then show a plot with the coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.05:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# Moplotting
MoPlotTwoWay(modello, coef = T, focus = F, sig.level = 0.05)
```


### 2.2 Custom Coding 
This example demonstrates how `MoPlotTwoWay()` can handle custom contrast matrices, allowing for flexible hypothesis testing in factorial designs. In this case, `Ind1` uses sum coding while `Ind2` uses a user-defined custom contrast matrix to explore non-standard comparisons between group levels.

We visualize single contrasts one by one using the option `Focus`.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# Generating a dataset
n <- 240
dt1 <- expand.grid(Ind1 = factor(c("A", "B", "C")),
                    Ind2 = factor(c("W", "X", "Y", "Z")))
dt1 <- dt1[rep(1:nrow(dt1), each = n / nrow(dt1)), ]
dt1$y <- with(dt1,5 +ifelse(Ind1 == "B", 2, ifelse(Ind1 == "C", -1, 0)) +
                ifelse(Ind2 == "X", 1, ifelse(Ind2 == "Y", 2, 
                                              ifelse(Ind2 == "Z", -2, 0))) +
                 ifelse(Ind1 == "C" & Ind2 == "Y", 3, 0) +
                 rnorm(nrow(dt1), 0, 1))

# Applying Sum and Custom contrasts
contrasts(dt1$Ind1) <- contr.sum(3)
custom_Ind2 <- matrix(c(1,  1, -1, -1, # W,X vs Y,Z
                      1, -1,  0,  0,   # arbitrary 
                      0,  0,  1, -1),  # arbitrary 
                    ncol = 3)
rownames(custom_Ind2) <- c("W", "X", "Y", "Z")
colnames(custom_Ind2) <- c("WX_vs_YZ", "W_vs_X", "Y_vs_Z")
contrasts(dt1$Ind2) <- custom_Ind2

# Model fitting
model_custom <- lm(y ~ Ind2 * Ind1, data = dt1)

# MoPlotting
MoPlotTwoWay(model_custom, focus=T)
```
