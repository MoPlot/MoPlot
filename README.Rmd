MoPlot is an R package designed to visualize linear models that include categorical predictors. It enhances the interpretability of complex model outputs through clear and intuitive graphical representations, with a particular focus on the contrasts used for categorical variables. By highlighting these contrasts, MoPlot helps users better understand the specific comparisons underlying model estimates.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MoPlot like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Moplot/Moplot")
```

## 1. MoPlotOneWay

`MoPlotOneWay()` is a function for visualizing the results of a linear model with one categorical predictor and one numeric dependent variable. It takes as input a model created with `lm()` and produces a plot that highlights group means with their associated uncertainty using bars, and visually emphasizes significant contrasts through colored lines. Optionally, the raw data points can be displayed in the plot. A secondary panel shows the model coefficients, including standardized beta values and effect sizes such as Cohen’s *d*, allowing for a clear and informative summary of the model's findings.  `MoPlotOneWay()` function supports a variety of contrast coding schemes for categorical predictors, including treatment coding (dummy coding), sum to zero coding, Helmert coding, reverse Helmert coding, polynomial coding, sliding difference coding, and customized coding.

### 1.1 Default Treatment coding

Treatment coding, or dummy coding is a common way to represent categorical variables in regression models. It transforms a categorical predictor with k levels into k − 1 binary (0/1) variables, each comparing one level to a reference (baseline) category.
The following example uses the classic iris dataset with treatment contrasts and shows the plot without raw data points or coefficient panel, using a significance level of 0.05:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
library(MoPlot)

# Using Iris data
data(iris)
iris$Species <- factor(iris$Species)
contrasts(iris$Species) <- contr.treatment(3)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

Here is the same plot, but including raw data points and the coefficient panel, also with a 0.05 significance level:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

### 1.2 Sum coding

Sum coding is another way to represent categorical variables in regression models. Unlike treatment coding, sum coding compares each level to the overall mean rather than a specific reference group. The following example uses again the iris dataset with sum contrasts, showing the plot without raw data points or coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.1

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
# Using Sum coding
contrasts(iris$Species) <- contr.sum(3)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)

# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.1)
```

Here is the same plot including raw data points and the coefficient panel:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.1)
```

### 1.3 Helmert coding

Helmert coding is a contrast coding scheme where each level of a categorical variable is compared to the mean of previous levels. The following example uses a generated dataset (using `DatasetOne()`) with Helmert contrasts. It first shows a plot without raw data points or coefficient panel at a significance level of 0.05:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
# Using a custom function to generate data with four groups
DT <- DatasetOne(n_sample = 20, means = c(120, 135, 115, 120), sds = 20)
DT$Ind <- as.factor(DT$Ind)
contrasts(DT$Ind) <- contr.helmert(4)

# Fit the model
model <- lm(Dep ~ Ind, data = DT)

# MoPlotting sum
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = FALSE, coef = FALSE, siglevel = 0.05)
```

Here is the same plot including raw data points and the coefficient panel, using a 0.2 significance level:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
# MoPlotting sum
MoPlotOneWay(model, data = TRUE, coef = TRUE, siglevel = 0.2)
```


## 2. MoPlotTwoWay

## `MoPlotTwoWay()`

`MoPlotTwoWay()` is a function for visualizing the results of a linear model with two categorical predictors including their interaction, and one numeric dependent variable. It takes as input a model created with `lm()` and produces a plot that highlights marginal means with their associated uncertainty using error bars. Significant interaction contrasts are visually emphasized using colored lines. Optionally, a secondary panel displays the model coefficients, including standardized beta values and effect sizes such as Cohen’s *d*, providing a clear and informative summary of the model's findings.


### 1.1 Default Treatment coding

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE} 
#  n <- 200
# dati <- expand.grid(
#   Fattore1 = factor(c("A", "B", "C")),
#   Fattore2 = factor(c("X", "Y"))
# )
# 
# dati <- dati[rep(1:nrow(dati), each = n / nrow(dati)), ]
# dati$y <- with(dati,
#                3 +
#                  ifelse(Fattore1 == "B", 2, ifelse(Fattore1 == "C", -1, 0)) +
#                  ifelse(Fattore2 == "Y", 1, 0) +
#                  ifelse(Fattore1 == "C" & Fattore2 == "Y", 2, 0) +
#                  rnorm(nrow(dati), 0, 1)
# )
# 
# contrasts(dati$Fattore1) <- contr.helmert(3)
# contrasts(dati$Fattore2) <- contr.sum(2)
# 
# modello <- lm(y ~ Fattore1 * Fattore2, data = dati)
# 
# MoPlotTwoWay(modello)
```
