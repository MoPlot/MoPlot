\title{Plot Interactions Linear Models}
\usage{
MoPlotTwoWay(LinearModel2Way, sig.level = 0.05, coef = TRUE, focus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{LinearModel2Way}{A fitted \code{lm} model object.}

\item{sig.level}{Numeric. Significance threshold for highlighting contrasts. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{coef}{Logical. Whether to include coefficient plots. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{focus}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, plots are printed separately (one per contrast); if \code{FALSE}, combined using \code{patchwork}.}
}
\value{
Plots of estimated means and interaction contrasts
}
\description{
This function generates plots of estimated means and interaction contrasts
from a two-way model with interaction terms. It can visualize contrasts with or without
coefficients, and optionally combine all plots.
}
\details{
Works only for models with two categorical predictors and their interaction.
Colors and annotations in plots change based on the significance level (\code{sig.level}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- lm(y ~ A * B, data = mydata)
MoPlotTwoWay(model, sig.level = 0.05, coef = TRUE, focus = FALSE)
}
