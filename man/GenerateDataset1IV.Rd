\title{Generate a Dataset with One Categorical Independent Variable and One Continuous Dependent Variable}
\usage{
GenerateDataset1IV(n_sample, means, sds)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_sample}{Number of observations per group.}

\item{means}{A numeric vector of group means.}

\item{sds}{A single numeric value representing the shared standard deviation.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{iv} (group identifier) and \code{dv} (dependent variable).
}
\description{
This function simulates a dataset with multiple groups (levels of one IV),
each with a specified mean and a shared standard deviation. The dependent
variable is continuous, and the standard deviation is constant across groups,
emulating homoscedasticity. The number of observations per group is equal,
creating a balanced design.
