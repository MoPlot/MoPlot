\title{Plot One-Way Linear Model Highlighting Contrasts}
\usage{
MoPlotOneWay(
  LinearMod,
  data = FALSE,
  siglevel = 0.05,
  coef = FALSE,
  facet.pers = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LinearMod}{A fitted linear model object (from \code{lm()}) with one numeric response and one categorical predictor.}

\item{data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, overlays individual data points on the plot (default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{siglevel}{Numeric. Significance level for testing contrasts and confidence intervals (default: \code{0.05}).}

\item{coef}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds a second panel with coefficients and standardized effect sizes (default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{facet.pers}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} personalized contrasts are seen one by one (default: \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} plot object or a combined plot (with \pkg{patchwork}) if \code{coef = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Visualizes a one-way linear model with a single categorical predictor and numeric dependent variable.
Supports multiple contrast types including treatment, sum, successive differences (sdif), Helmert,
reverse Helmert, polynomial and customized contrasts.
}
\details{
The plot shows means, confidence intervals, significance of contrasts, and optionally overlays raw data points.
It also display standardized coefficients and effect sizes.

Supported contrast types and their interpretations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Treatment:} Each group is compared to a baseline (first level).
\item \strong{Sum:} Contrasts compare each group to the grand mean.
\item \strong{Successive differences (sdif):} Each group is compared to the previous one.
\item \strong{Helmert:} Each group is compared to the mean of all previous groups.
\item \strong{Reverse Helmert:} Each group is compared to the mean of all subsequent groups.
\item \strong{Polynomial:} Contrasts test polynomial trends across ordered factor levels.
\item \strong{Customized:} User-defined contrasts.
}

Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Significant contrasts are highlighted according to the chosen significance level.
The coefficient panel (if enabled) shows coefficient estimates with confidence intervals and standardized effect sizes.
